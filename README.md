# Hello Candidate!

Thank you for applying to YearOne. We are very excited to help you on your journey to becoming a software engineer, and are looking forward to highlighting your skills for our partner companies. 

This phase of our application process will have you work through an API design in your choice of language and framework. This phase of the application is assessing your familiarity with your chosen language and your practical coding skills. You can add as many or as few features as you want, so long as you meet the requirements listed below. 

# API Instructions:
We’re building a small web application that allows a user to search for a movie title, click on that movie title for more information, and give that movie a thumbs up or thumbs down. 

# Deliverables:

Search functionality that allows a user to enter a title and receive back movie information. (Choose a free API for movie data. https://rapidapi.com/collection/movie-apis OR any API that provides this info!)
A user should be able to look through title results, if there are more than one, and choose one to read more about. (A good movie to test this with is SpiderMan).
The movie detail page should have the following information at a minimum:
Title
Director
Release Year
Description (if your API provides it)
Ability to thumbs up or thumbs down the movie (see below)
Implement some type of storage or database to persist movie titles and how many thumbs up or thumbs down they’ve received. No need to add movies that have not received any votes. A sample table is below.
Movie Title
Thumbs Up
Thumbs Down

# Clarifications: 
No need to handle user login or any sort of authentication.
Design and aesthetic is not scored for this phase of the interview, however, these projects will be shared with prospective employers if you become a finalist of YearOne. If front-end or full-stack is your goal, this is a good opportunity to shine. 
Additional back-end work/testing is not scored for this phase of the interview, however, these projects will be shared with prospective employers if you become a finalist of YearOne. Testing or further work on the back-end of the API could be a good opportunity to shine if back-end is your goal. 
Submission Instructions:
You will be providing us with a link to the repository that holds this project. PLEASE double check that the repository is not private, and can be viewed publicly. 
Please include a README.md file with the following information:
How to setup and run your application
Photos or Gif of your web app (search page and movie detail page) 
IMPORTANT! Once completed, you must submit your API repository URL here before November 27th at 11:59 p.m.
That’s it!

We’ll review your submission and get back to you as soon as we can with next steps. Thank you for your time and efforts during this process. No matter what happens, we wish you all the best in your job search.
